## About
Hi! My name is Aiwei Liu (刘瑷玮). I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I am advised by Prof. [Lijie Wen](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/faculty/wenlijie.htm).

My research interests lie in the fields of natural language processing and deep learning. In particular, I am interested in mining structured information from heterogeneous information sources and focus on:

- Semantic parsing.
- Robustness of natural language models.
